# DaoVotingCw4

This is the voting module adapter for the
[`dao-voting-cw4`](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/tree/main/contracts/voting/dao-voting-cw4)
contract, which determines DAO voting power based on the weight according to a
[cw4-group](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/cw-plus/0.9.0/cw4/cw4-group-spec)
contract. This represents the membership-based DAO structure, where members are
added, modified, and removed via DAO governance. This is also known as a
**multisig**.
