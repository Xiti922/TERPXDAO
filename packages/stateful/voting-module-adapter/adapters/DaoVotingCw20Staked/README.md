# DaoVotingCw20Staked

This is the voting module adapter for the
[`dao-voting-cw20-staked`](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts/tree/main/contracts/voting/dao-voting-cw20-staked)
contract, which determines DAO voting power based on the staked balance of its
chosen [CW20](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/cw-plus/0.9.0/cw20/spec) token. This
represents the CW20 governance token-based DAO structure, where members are free
to exchange their unstaked tokens with other parties at any time.
